# Jakarta AQI Dashboard (2024)

This project is an interactive dashboard built using Python, Dash, and Plotly to visualize Jakarta's Air Quality Index (AQI) data for 2024. The dashboard allows users to explore daily AQI trends, traffic congestion, temperature, and wind speed through interactive charts and a date slider.

## Features

- **Line Chart**: Shows daily AQI trends over time.
- **AQI Classification**: Categorizes AQI into levels (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) with associated health implications.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time updates to charts and information based on user input from the date slider.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Dash**: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- **Plotly**: Library for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
